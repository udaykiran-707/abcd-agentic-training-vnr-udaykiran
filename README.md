🚀 MULTI AGENT RESEARCHER & REPORT GENERATOR

An AI-powered multi-agent system that automates the complete research workflow — from data collection to structured report generation and PDF export.

---

🔁 Agentic Workflow

User Input → Research Agent → Filter Agent → Summarizer Agent → Writer Agent → PDF + UI Output

---

1. Business Problem

In today’s digital age, research is inefficient due to:

- Information overload from multiple sources
- Lack of a unified system to aggregate data
- Difficulty in summarizing large content
- Time-consuming report formatting

---

2. Possible Solution

- Use Agentic Workflow (Researcher, Filter, Summarizer, Writer)
- Apply NLP Models (BART/T5) for summarization
- Use Web APIs (Wikipedia, DuckDuckGo) for data collection
- Generate reports dynamically using PDF libraries

---

3. Implemented Solution

A fully functional Multi-Agent Research System built in Python.

🔁 Workflow:

- 🔍 Research Agent → Collects data from Wikipedia & web
- 🧹 Filter Agent → Cleans unwanted data
- 🧠 Summarizer Agent → Uses BART model for summarization
- 📄 Writer Agent → Creates structured report
- 📥 PDF Generator → Generates downloadable report
- 💾 Memory → Stores history in JSON

---

⚙️ How It Works

1. User enters a topic
2. System collects and processes data using agents
3. Generates structured report
4. Converts it into downloadable PDF
5. Stores history for future use

---

✨ Features

- Multi-agent architecture
- Real-time agent execution visualization
- Automated research → filtering → reporting pipeline
- PDF report generation
- Memory-based history tracking
- Interactive Streamlit UI
- Deployed and accessible online

10. Problems Faced and Solutions

- Token limit errors → Implemented chunking to handle large text inputs  
- API costs → Used DuckDuckGo search to avoid paid APIs  
- Wikipedia ambiguity → Added error handling for disambiguation issues  
- PDF encoding issues → Cleaned text to remove unsupported characters  
- Slow UI → Used caching and Streamlit spinner for better performance
